IoT BASED SMART AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM

The IoT-based Smart Agriculture System aims to transform conventional farming methods by 
utilizing cutting-edge technologies to improve production, sustainability, and efficiency. In 
order to decrease manual intervention and increase operational efficiency, important 
agricultural activities including irrigation management and farm security measures should be 
automated. The goal of real-time monitoring and data collecting is to collect information from 
multiple sensors that are placed around the farm in order to enable quick decision-making and 
intervention based on the state of the environment. To efficiently fulfill its goals, the hardware, software, and communication protocols are 
systematically integrated as part of the methodology for the Internet of Things-based Smart 
Agriculture System. Setting up sensors and actuators for specialized agricultural jobs coupled 
with microcontrollers such as NodeMCU and ESP32 constitutes the first step in hardware 
setup. This comprises actuators, such as water pumps managed by relays, and sensors, such as 
soil moisture sensors and passive infrared (PIR) sensors for motion detection.  
Software development includes creating code to create communication protocols between 
nodes, control actuators based on sensor readings, and gather data from sensors. Using 
protocols as ESPNOW and UART, this entails creating firmware for microcontrollers to 
manage actuator control, data transmission between nodes, and sensor data gathering. In order 
to guarantee smooth operation, the different components are brought together during the critical 
integration phase. To ensure that each node is operating as intended and that they are 
communicating with one another, extensive testing is required. MongoDB is set up and 
installed on the central server to manage and store data.
